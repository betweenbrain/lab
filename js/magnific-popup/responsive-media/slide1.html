		In addition to working individually, this husband and wife also collaborate with one another in a range of media including painting, video, performance, and installation. In 2009, the artists began the multicomponent work 1000 Pieces (of White), gathering and producing objects and images to assemble a portrait of their shared life. Acquired for the Guggenheim’s collection, Four (Pieces of White) gathers four components of the more politically inflected experiences represented in the couple’s expansive project. While both artists have been the subject of several exhibitions individually, their collaborative work has been featured at Art-U room, Tokyo (2011); the Meulensteen Project Space, New York (2011); the 11th Asian Art Biennial, Dhaka, Bangladesh (2004); 6th Asia Pacific Triennial; and Video, an Art, a History, 1965–2010, Singapore Art Museum (2011). They live and work in Yangon, Myanmar.
